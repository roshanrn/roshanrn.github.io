 I am a Staff Engineer at [Samsung Semiconductor (Bangalore, India)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/samsungsemiconductor/), where I work on data placement technologies involving SSDs, distributed storage systems, workload analysis and the applications of machine learning in systems.
         	
I currently work on data grouping problems and data placement methods involving SSDs, specifically [Flexible Data Placement (FDP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEISXHcNmSk) and its integration to various application stacks (ex. [CacheLib](https://cachelib.org/)). 

In the past, I have worked on disaggregated storage systems and distributed systems, specifically researching the topics of Data Replication, State Machine Replication (Consensus Algorithms), flexible node scaling, etc. I have also worked on workload analysis, specifically focusing on using machine learning to perform workload characterisation. 

Prior to joining Samsung full time in 2020, I completed my Masters in Mathematics and Bachelors in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [BITS Pilani, Goa](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/). During my time there I worked on the research areas of Mathematical Modelling and Disease Dynamics (stability analysis) under the guidance of [Prof. Amit Setia](https://scholar.google.com/citationsuser=Wt02vywAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra).

I enjoy teaching and I strongly believe in free access to information, especially in an academic setting. Given this belief I share academic knowledge (when time permits) from my experiences thus far in the field of Mathematics  on my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@nairsrealm4749). In the coming years, I hope to spend more time on teaching.

In my free time I like to play chess, watch football, read (mostly fiction) and indulge in art and writing as well. I also enjoy talking long walks and listening to music.

Research Interests
======

My research interests lie in distributed storage systems, the application of machine learning in solving storage systems problems, workload characterisation and classification, data grouping problems in SSDs and mathematical modelling.
