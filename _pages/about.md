I am a Staff Engineer at [Samsung Semiconductor (Bangalore, India)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/samsungsemiconductor/), where I work in the Advanced R&D Team under the Memory Solutions Group. I'm also a member of Samsung's Global Open eco-System Team (GOST). I currently work on CXL memory pooling and memory tiering solutions to enable the deployment of Samsung's CMM-X hardware. 

In the past I worked on data grouping problems and data placement technologies involving SSDs, specifically [Flexible Data Placement (FDP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEISXHcNmSk) and its integration to various application stacks (ex. [CacheLib](https://cachelib.org/)). I have also worked on disaggregated storage systems and distributed systems, specifically researching the topics of data replication, state machine replication (consensus algorithms - raft), flexible node scaling and failure recovery, etc. I have also worked on workload analysis, specifically focusing on using machine learning to perform workload characterisation. 

Prior to joining Samsung full time in 2020, I completed my Masters in Mathematics and Bachelors in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [BITS Pilani, Goa](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/). During my time there I worked on the research areas of Mathematical Modelling and Disease Dynamics (stability analysis) under the guidance of [Prof. Amit Setia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Wt02vywAAAAJ&hl=en)

I enjoy teaching and I strongly believe in free access to information. In the short break I had during the pandemic between graduating from college and starting full-time at Samsung, I put up Mathematics videos on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@nairsrealm4749) based on the knowledge I accrued in college. In the coming years, I hope to spend more time on teaching Mathematics and Computer Science!  
In my free time I like to play chess, table tennis, watch football, read (mostly fiction) and indulge in art and writing as well. I also enjoy taking long walks and listening to music.


Research Interests
======

My research interests broadly lie in using memory and storage systems to buld high performance large scale systems. I often make use of mathematical modeling to create models and simulator to better understand the systems I work on. I am also interested in researching and improving the power efficiency and sustainability of large scale datacenter systems.
