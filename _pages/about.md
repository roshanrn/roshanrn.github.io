 I am a research engineer at [Samsung Semiconductor (Bangalore, India)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/samsungsemiconductor/), where I work on data placement technologies involving SSDs, distributed storage systems, workload analysis and the applications of machine learning in systems.
         	
I currently work on data grouping problems and data placement methods involving SSDs, specifically [Flexible Data Placement (FDP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEISXHcNmSk) and its integration to various application stacks (ex. [CacheLib](https://cachelib.org/). 

In the past, I have worked on disaggregated storage systems and distributed systems, specifically researching the topics of Data Replication, State Machine Replication (Consensus Algorithms), flexible node scaling, etc. I have also worked on workload analysis, specifically focusing on using machine learning to perform workload characterisation. 

Prior to joining Samsung, I completed my Masters in Mathematics and Bachelors in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [BITS Pilani, Goa](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/). During my time there I worked on the research areas of Mathematical Modelling and Disease Dynamics (stability analysis) under the guidance of [Prof. Amit Setia](https://scholar.google.com/citationsuser=Wt02vywAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra).

In my free time I like to play chess, watch football, read (mostly fiction) and I occassionally write as well. 

Research Interests
======

My research interests lie in distributed storage systems, the application of machine learning in solving storage systems problems, workload characterisation and classification, data grouping problems in SSDs and mathematical modelling.
